### README.md

#### Running the file
As per the pset, you can run:

1. make strassen
2. ./strassen 0 dimension inputfile

You can also directly run:
python strassen.py 0 dimension inputfile

For ex. 
python strassen.py 0 3 ex.txt


#### Note about running on nice
This may not work, since I used numpy arrays (checked that this was ok on Piazza), and I don't beleive nice has numpy installed.

#### Questions?
Feel free to contact me directly via email if you have questions. The code should be pretty thoroughly commented though. Some helper functions for testing are included (but commented out) for reference.
